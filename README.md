# Introduction
I had an internship interview in early July 2023. Following the interview I had with the hiring manager, I was a given a case study to work on as part of the hiring process. The questions and instructions are as follows:

Problem:
There was a tale when 2 prime numbers collided and a big bang happened. Scientists found out
the 2 prime numbers are 3 and 5 but they need a model to generate an array of numbers to
predict when the big bang will happen again.

Solution:
Create a script to iterate through 1 to 100 and replace any number divisible by 3 with the word
BIG number divisible by 5 with the word BANG. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, replace it
with BIG BANG. Generate the array and output to ‘output.json’ file with result as follow:
[“1”, “2”, “BIG”, “4”, “BANG”, “BIG”, “7”, “8”, “BIG”, “BANG”, “11”, “BIG”, “13”, “14”, “BIGBANG”,
…. all the way to 100]

# Getting Started

//How to run the script;
//using Visual Studio Code

1. Clone or download the folder zip
2. Unzip the folder
3. Open bigbang.js with Visual Studio Code
4. Click run (run without debugging)
5. output.json will be generated
